具有复杂流固边界的流动现象广泛出现在化石能源开采、新能源技术开发、化工过程、环境保护等领域，
这类流动现象通常还耦合多组分/多相组分、化学反应等复杂现象。
%常规计算流体力学方法
格子Boltzmann方法（LBM）由于能够高效处理复杂流固边界、容易耦合多相模型模型而成为研究这类问题的有力工具。
LBM在计算上具有天然并行性，非常适合于在近几年新出现的通用图形处理器（GPGPU）上并行实现。

现代图形处理器（GPU）的计算能力和存储带宽远远超过了目前主流的CPU，其性能/价格比和
性能/能耗比相对于传统的基于CPU的计算机集群或多核计算机具有很大优势。

本文利用CUDA GPU的编程技术，编制了LBM的GPU计算程序，模拟了多孔介质内（复杂边界）
单组分单相和多组分多相流动，重点研究了复杂流固边界与多组分LBM模型在GPU上的高效处理方法，
并对程序做了性能测试和分析。
